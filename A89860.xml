            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:154301:2" rendition="simple:additions"/> FOraſmuch as a right Faith is the onely ground of mans Eternal happineſs, and the onely thing which gains the Creature an entrance towards his Creator, and without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, though much hath been ſaid of it already, yet I having found by learning the true and living faith which hath the living power, different from that faith which is dead and without that power; And ſeeing that ſo many at this day are at eaſe in a dead faith, and their ſouls in the grave, In tender love thereto I am ſtirred up to declare ſomething of the faith of Chriſt which I have found onely effectual to Salvation and Reconciliation with God. And ſomewhat the rather in regard the Enemy hath ſpread ſo many falſe reports of me touching my faith in Chriſt Jeſus, which here I ſhall declare in plaineneſſe, for the ſatisfying of ſimple minds who deſire to know Truth rather then to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it; and for thoſe who ſeek occaſion, I chuſe rather to bear their reproach that are in that Nature, then contend therewith, for my work is not with Fleſh and Blood, nor is it in my Spirit to ſtrive with any about words that ſtir up ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and contention and edefie not, but with God I ſtrive dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to that of God in all I ſeek to be manifeſt which reſiſts not evil, but ſeek to overcome it with good, waiting for the Kingdom of God in all, and the Souls Redemption out of death, and the Seed out of bondage, and where that is not effected in meaſure, I look not to be owned, nor my witneſs received, though it be not of my ſelf, but Chriſt Jeſus in me.</p>
            <p>And firſt a Faith or belief I have found in the World, of which I ſhall ſay little in this place, having found indeed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in it to the Salvation of Life; It's a literal Faith ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Hiſtory of the Scripture touching God and Chriſt, and what Chriſt did in that Temple which the Jewes deſtroyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. but doth not know him in Spirit, nor believe him as his Name is EMANUEL to all Generations, and ſo doth not neceſsarily work the believer into a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to that head, in his then walking, by his coming again in <pb n="4" facs="tcp:154301:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſame Spirit and Power, working in them the ſame Will, Mind, and Affections, and Obedience to the Father in their meaſure which was in him the Example, Author, Worker and Finiſher of the True and Living Faith.</p>
            <p>And of this Faith (being ſomewhat dreſſed by the ſeveral Opinions of men) are all the unclean Spirits living in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever abomination is to be mentioned in the world, all Sects and Opinions, or whatever may be found in all Colours in theſe Northern Parts of the World, with this Faith they are covered, and this is their ſtrength, and here they take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to themſelves againſt all Reproof within or from without, though living openly in the greateſt Wholedonies againſt the Spirit of Holineſs, Carnal or Spiritual that can be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, even at a diſtance from Chriſt in his whole life, yet they believe Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of which they are chief; and they that are whole need not the Phyſitian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the greater their wickedneſſe is, the nearer to Chriſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; And by this Faith he that came to ſave People from ſin and to lead out of ſin both by Example and Spirit, is made a cover for all filthineſs of fleſh and Spirit, and to ſtrengthen the heart of wickedneſſe againſt the life of holineſſe, ſome in one ſin ſome in another, but with this Faith do all ſorts ſtrengthen themſelves and hardens their hearts againſt the light of Chriſt and that Spirit which reproves the World of ſin, and convinceth of it, and would lead out of it; and hence it is that the witneſſe of God that is holy in all, is trampled under foot in all, and little regarded in any, but by this Faith believed on in none to be the way to the Father, though the world have no light but it, nor is there a Promiſe of Life in any other: And this to me appears to be that Faith of the Devil or dead Faith the Apoſtle ſpeaks on,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 2. though more hardned in it againſt Gods fear, for the Devils when they believe tremble at it; So this Faith I leave, being judged already by its fruits with the light of Chriſt in every honeſt heart that loves holineſs.</p>
            <p>And of that Faith I ſhall ſpeak ſomthing in which I have found a meaſure of the Life of Chriſt made manifeſt in my mortal Body, in which life alone is the True and Eternal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and atonement with the Holy God, into whom no unclean <pb n="5" facs="tcp:154301:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing can enter, And this is not a notion of what was done in another generation paſt or to come, hundreds or thouſands of years diſtance, but that which leads to the beginning of the work of a new Creature at this day, and a new birth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally begotten and born and brought to light, without which none can ſee the Kingdom of God nor enter therein; And this Faith doth not work by the comprehenſions of brain knowledge, that becauſe I could here conceive or declare of Chriſt Jeſus, from the beginning to the age thereof in words or thoughts, that therefore I have learned him, or know him as I ought to do, or am grown up in him to a perfect man, and ſo to deceive others by declaring and boaſting of what God hath not wrought in me, as a man may eaſily do and deceive his own ſoul, and bewitch others alſo, by leading them out of their meaſures of Gods preſent work in them. But of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith wch now worketh powerfully in ſpirit by love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the miſtery whereof is holden forth in a pure conſcience, working out the old leven, purifying the heart and making all things new, judging and killing and crucifying with Chriſt in ſpirit the works of the fleſh, and caſting out every thing in me that is not of God, and renewing in me the things of God in their order by his mighty working in me, in which the ſoul is raiſed out of the grave, and the dead reſtored to life, actually and not in conceit. Of the Grounds and Workings of this Living Faith I ſhall ſpeak ſomething.</p>
            <p>And though the foundation of this Faith or beginning of it was, that I did really believe in that which Chriſt did and ſuffered at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that therein that veſſel he bare the ſins of the World, and ſatisfied the wrath of God for ſins paſt, and overcame death, hell and the grave, and made way for the Seed to ariſe in all through the whole World who would believe in his light which then ſhined through him to all men, wherein he might be ſeen to be the Way, the Truth and the Life apparent, openly triumphing over all that had paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Seed. And much more might be ſaid of him there finiſhed, all which I did believe according to Scripture, which was as an opening of me to receive him from Heaven in the ſame ſpirit and power, without which I could not have received the gift of that holy Spirit, God having ſo purpoſed from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154301:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> beginning, that the Covenant of Eternal Life and power ſhould be received no other way but by faith in him, who in the fulneſs of time was there manifeſt in fleſh, for the taking away ſins paſt, and making a way for the Reſurrection of life over all, to ſave from ſins for time to come.</p>
            <p>The effect of which Faith when in the Light I firſt received it, did turn my mind out of all my ſins paſt, and took my mind out of them and turned me towards God, and holineſs of life I then believed to attain in that faith, and receive power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to grow up in him to his fulneſs and ſtature, which then I ſee no leſs Faith could ſave me then the perfect Faith of the Son God, which before I had not received, but then received with ſuch gladneſſe of heart, that it ſet my face and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights out of all ſin towards the perfection of Chriſt in which I then believed, which was the Joy then ſet before me; yet was not the work done and finiſhed in me already, though (I having received the Faith and Hope of the Son of God, and was turned from all my former ſin and my own righteouſneſs, ſo that) if I had departed this Body, I had died in no leſs Faith then the Holy Faith of Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo being turned to his Spirit out of the works of the Fleſh, I was turned from my ſin, and ſo from condemnation, yet was there a great work to do in me before I could witneſs freedom from the body of death, and the root and ground of evil removed, and the ſeed raiſed to reign, and the ſoul brought into the holy City, the reſurrection of the dead, and fellowſhip in the Father and the Son, &amp;c. And that glorious liberty of the new Creature, and all things to be of God in me, as the ſcriptures do witneſs; ſo this faith didnot work me into a conceit of my ſelf, glorying in knowledge, and ſo to become a Teacher of others what I had conceived below the life, but it led me down into the obedience of the Spirit of Light, to wait therein for the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Life, and I came to ſee in that Light that the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin did ſtill work from the old ground and root, and that muſt be removed by the power of Chriſt working in ſpirit, and my obedience and watchfulneſs therein was required, and that without obedience to this faith I could not come to perfect victory over the enmity, nor the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; for though this faith had turned my heart towards <pb n="7" facs="tcp:154301:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt and given me hope to attain him, yet I had not then learned him, nor was he yet formed in me, ſo was I led in the Light of Chriſt, to ſee what I had of this treaſure in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en veſsel, which I found to be in me very little, and that Seed the leaſt of all Seeds, ſo I became little in that eye which told me the Truth, though I had been high in my own thoughts formerly.</p>
            <p>And ſo to the Word of the beginning of Chriſt I was led, or the firſt Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, that with that which teacheth Chriſt, I might learn Chriſt in every meaſure of him as I grew therein; ſo was I brought to know him that was made under the Law, and to the foundation of repentance from dead works, and to Doctrines of Baptiſms, and to Eternal Judgement; Then came I in Truth and Life to ſee what they were doing whom the Apoſtles exhorted to work out their own Salvation with fear and trembling, after they had fully belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what Chriſt had done for them at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in that veſſel, and many other Scriptures did he open to me as I learned him, which before to me was a Miſtery, while I learned them in meanings without the Life of Chriſt, which then was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Revelation of Chriſt Jeſus as they came to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in me, being led by the ſame Spirit in that work of Faith; then came I to ſee that I through the Law muſt be redeemed from the Law, and that my redemption from it muſt not be by making it void, but by fulfilling of it, and till then it had power over me, and ſin took occaſion by it to ſtrengthen it ſelf in me; but as I came to grow in the Spirit and Power of Chriſt, I was in him brought through it, it in him fulfilled, and I dead to it as it came to be fulfilled, and the words of Chriſt I found true, <hi>I came not to break the Law but to fulfil it,</hi> and it is eaſier for Heaven &amp; Earth to paſs away then one jot of the Law to paſs away tell it be fulfilled, and I needed not a meaning to that Scripture, but a fulfilling thereof in Chriſt Jeſus; And the School-maſter that brings to Chriſt I learned, &amp; Chriſt formed, &amp; the heir under Tutors, before I knew the liberty of the Son of God or perfect freedom, and then I ſaw the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures could not be broken nor wreſted, but it muſt be learned in the life of it to Salvation, which the unlearned wreſt to their own deſtruction by meanings without life, and that it was of <pb n="8" facs="tcp:154301:5"/> no private interpretation, but this one Spirit muſt open it all in the fulfilling thereof, and this Faith in Chriſt Jeſus onely was able to make wiſe unto Salvation of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>And then came I clearly to ſee Chriſt Jeſus ſet before me in all things that I was to go through, in that faith which I had firſt received, and that the attaining of him was the hope of glory, and no hope without him; and this hope was as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in all hardſhips and temptations, which was not a few I was led through, but all was counted little while I ſtood in this Faith, for the hope that was in me to win Chriſt; And I clearly ſaw that now with ſtanding my firſt faith in what he had done at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet if I did not continue therein to follow the ſame ſpirit in obedience thereto, believing therein, in all its leadings hoping to attain to Chriſt Jeſus the end of that Faith, in daily growing towards his Stature and fulneſſe, but had turned aſide, or ſet down ſhort of the leadings of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the way, I had made void my hope of Glory, the work of my redemption, and that which Chriſt did at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as to me) and had denyed my firſt Faith, and could not have been ſaved from wrath to come. That being the end of that Faith committed to me, that therein I might faithfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting follow him in Spirit through all Tryals and Temptations, of which way he was a perfect example in his walking in that Fleſh at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that through the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I might have hope, ſeeing he went the ſame way before me there in which he now leads, and that therein I might ſee him to be the ſame to all Generations as he was there, and in his Saints that followed him. And as they exhorted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to look unto him in their Travel, who was the Author and Finiſher of their Faith, and to conſider him as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who endured ſuch contradictions of ſinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, leaſt they ſhould be weary of ſuffering and faint in their minds, and ſo their Faith and Hope was ſtrengthened; So alſo I looking to the ſame in him and alſo in them after him, my Faith and Patience might be doubled, and my obedience made without doubting, and my hope firm unto the end, which end was the wining Chriſt in me the Hope of Glory, the great Miſtery of Faith, which is hid from all till the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="9" facs="tcp:154301:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo when the Saints and Apoſtles had Chriſt revealed in them, they were able Miniſters of him, and had the myſtery opened, and Preached it without doubt, that myſtery of godlineſs, which was great yet hid from the world, but to them without all controverſie, God manifeſt in fleſh, not God fleſh, but manifeſt in fleſh, which myſtery of Faith they held in a pure conſcience, and ſo I knew my Faith to be the ſame Faith once delivered to the Saints, and the good fight of that Faith I came to know, and that Faith which overcomes the world, which hath the promiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Eternal life, which all that go back from denyes the Faith of Chriſt, and ſets up a Faith without Chriſt which is not the faith of Chriſt, and ſo in the learning of Chriſt I came to ſee the Faith of Chriſt from faith to faith, and the faith of Devils, the living working faith, and the dead faith without works, and I find that Chriſt never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he could never be perfect nor overcome the Devil, nor overcome ſin, it was never the Faith of Chriſt to make void the Law of his Father unfulfilled in him; it was never his faith to revenge evil but to overcome it with good, it was never his faith to reſpect perſons, or that he could commit ſin and not be the ſervant of ſin; it was never his faith to ſue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or fight or perſecute any, to judge for rewards, or Preach for hire, or any way to ſerve the Mammon of this world, it was not his Faith to obſerve his own will, his own times, or the worlds cuſtomes, but to obſerve his Father in all things, and onely what he received from him that he did, and could do nothing of himſelf, he never believed them to be children of God who ſaid and did not.</p>
            <p>And much ſuch like things as theſe were never by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but is the worlds faith to uphold them in ſin &amp; luſts, who are enemies to the Faith of Chriſt wch preſents perfect to God by working out ſuch evils; All whieh I eame to ſee, not by man, but in the Revelation of Chriſt as in his Faith I learned him, growing into his Faith, into him and his life therein made manifeſt in my body; So I ſee what is his in truth as the truth is in Jeſus, and what is the worlds and but called his to oppoſe him; And I ſee that which loves the things of this world to be none of his love, nor that his joy that takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in viſible things, nor that his liberty which is in the works <pb n="10" facs="tcp:154301:6"/> of the fleſh, nor that his peace that is in ſin, nor that his patience thats ſeeks it own revenge, nor that his glory thats in pride, nor that his worſhip wch ſtands in carnal things, nor that his honour thats ſought of men, nor that his knowledge thats after the fleſh, nor that his fear that is taught by the precepts of men, theſe are in the world and not in him, but have onely got the name to be his, but are enemies to his life, and were never begat of his Father nor learned in the Son; all which and much like ſtuff I came to ſee the deceit of, by that truth and ſimplicity I found in Chriſt, contrary to the will of man.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the life of Chriſt I have learned to know the growth of the Faith of Chriſt and the riches of it, and the end of it, which is Chriſt Jeſus in all its working, and I alſo know the worlds faith, its uncleanneſs whoſe end is not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Holineſs of Chriſt in life, but would live in the worlds delights and have Chriſt for a cover, and be ſaved by the righteouſneſs of another, which they have no mind to walk in themſelves; And ſo that faith works not by love which loves not the life of Chriſt, but are enemies to his Croſs, minding earthly things, and this is the earthly Faith, but the living Faith works by love to holineſs of life, and therefore purifies the heart, and the myſtery of it ſtands in a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within themſelves that have it, and not in telling and comprehending what was in another, for the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Holineſs that was in Chriſt and can Preach it, but cannot inherit it, becauſe they love not to live the life of it, and by this I know them both for ever, and all that prove them in the life of Chriſt ſhall witneſs with me, the end of the one is the life of Chriſt in which himſelf walked, and the ſame obedience of the ſame Spirit to the ſame Father by the ſame power, according to the proportion of Faith received from God, which Faith is from above, and ſo layes hold on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things for its ſtrength, and ſo brings forth heavenly fruits; The other profeſſeth and promiſes great things, but ends in the world and minds earthly things, and doth not purifie the heart, nor believes ever to attain the life of Chriſt, his ſtature or fulneſs, but counts it an errour in ſuch as preſs after ſuch attainments, and ſo the end of the converſation of one is Chriſt Jeſus to hold forth in life and Power, the ſame yeſterday and to day and for ever; The end of the other is a <pb n="11" facs="tcp:154301:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> liberty to ſin here while they can take any pleaſure in it, and ſanctification and ſalvation when they are dead, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end of each faith ſo it works, for its impoſſible for him that cannot believe holineſs to work holineſs, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each mans faith ſo muſt he inherit in this world and that which is to come</p>
            <p>And in the workings and attainments of this living power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faith I have found ſeveral meaſures according to my growth therein, from the Word of the beginning of Chriſt or the firſt Principle of Chriſt, and the fulneſs, age and ſtature of Chriſt, as betwixt a Babe &amp; a man grown in ſtrength, &amp; much working in ſpirit I found betwixt faith received of Chriſt Jeſus, &amp; Chriſt learned in me; for though I received the faith of his fulneſs in what he was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his fleſh there at once, yet had not I ſo learned him in Spirit &amp; life in my mortal fleſh nor put him on at once, but in the light of Faith I ſaw I was ſo to run as to win him before I could put him on, wherein I came to ſee and know my ſelf begotten again in him by faith towards God, who is the way to God, in which way I came to ſee the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father manifeſt in meaſure in me in the pure image of a Holy Child, ſeperate from the fleſhly ſinful ſeed, or Chriſt formed in me as the Scriptures witneſs, and when I did behold his pure image and his pure mind and nature ſo far contrary to my own, yet then was not he in his Kingdom nor all things put under his feet, nor could I ſay that Jeſus was then Lord in me, but by the Spirits working by this Faith I had received, and in hope thereof, was I made to endure the loſs of all things, and to deny all things that ever this holy Spirit did War againſt in me which might any way oppreſſe this holy plant or hinder its growth, owning his judgement in the light, upon what ever was in my heart or affections but him alone, though never ſo much gain in my account in the world, which judgement being owned &amp; conſented to againſt my ſelf and all my ſelf lovers, therein was I parted from them in judgement, and ſo then was they ſubdued by the powerful workings of that Spirit and put under his feet, and I ſet free from them to ariſe with him above them, being brought from under them, and this was not done all at once, but in order as he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the light to manifeſt every particular evil; And as that Faith I had received wrought by love to him a conſent in my <pb n="12" facs="tcp:154301:7"/> ſpirit to his juſt judgement upon them, and I made willing to give them up to the fire and to come out of them and joyn to him in the execution, leaſt he ſhould conſume me with them as it muſt have been had I ſtayed in them, and here I found the benefit of the light which goes before his face to prepare his way, and the ſalvation of Faith which ſaved me through hope of him, that I was not deſtroyed in my ſins, which Faith and hope gave me an entrance within the vail, or a hiding place in him while the indignation was over, which was to paſſe upon the man of ſin.</p>
            <p>And ſo a voice was heard in the wilderneſs calling out of ſin, into a way I knew not, but as the light of his Covenant led me in the ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> turning my heart towards him, that he might not ſmite the earth with a curſe at his coming, in which way ere I came into the Kingdom of Chriſt my pure reſt I met with many hardſhips and great travels, and many temptations and tryals within and without, but the greateſt enemies was yet within me, which would upon ever hardſhip be tempting with unbelief to deſtory this Faith and hope, which was all that I had ſet before me to encourage me to endure ſuch hardſhips, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the light in a way I had not known, and to walk in the Clouds to meet the Lord, and to leave my former knowledge and wiſdom, and glory and riches, to go in a way I had not walked, and to abide ſuch aſſaults on every hand, every foot the world which I was called out of ready to overtake me and compaſſe me about, and to turn me back again into what I had ſeen and enjoyed, behind me, ever ſeeking to perſwade me that I ſhould never attain to him that was ſet before me in the Faith and hope; Then come I clearly to ſee, that though I had received the Faith of Chriſt as a ſhield in this War, by which I was ſaved that the wrath of God took me not away in theſe temptings and murmurings, and reaſonings and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which did ariſe in the fleſhly part, yet the purchaſed poſſeſſion was not yet redeemed for me to enjoy at preſent, though I had heard and believed the Goſpel of ſalvation, and was ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe till I came to be builded up with Chriſt for an habitation of God through the the Spirit. And I found by dayly experience that my ſalvation was not compleat ſo long as my ſoul was ſubjected under any <pb n="13" facs="tcp:154301:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> earthly luſt or paſſion, nor the War over, but as by the mighty working of God in me by that Spirit this came to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued under the feet of Chriſt, and the Soul ſet above it with him to reign in the heavenly place; ſo was my Salvation nearer then when I believed, for the Soul is not ſafe while ſin lives, or the fleſh luſts, for that wars againſt the Soul, and every ſin wounds it, and this ſhall all know who are not paſt feeling, what ever their Faith be touching Chriſt Jeſus, or what was wrought in another, whilſt ſin defiles the Soul it is not ſafe, nor the honeſt heart hath peace and reſt, for the reſt and peace is placed in the Holy City where comes no unclean thing, into which the Soul enters not till that all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be fulfilled upon earth, &amp; the Soul ſingled from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; have put on immortality, &amp; death ſwallowed up in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, when the ſting is taken away, which is ſin, &amp; the ſtrength of ſin, which is the Law, which is not taken away but where it is fulfilled, there onely grace reigns through righteouſneſs, and this I found to be truth as the truth is found in Jeſus, as I came to learn him and put him on by Faith which I had believed; and I ſee the folly of ſuch as would make void the Law by tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Faith and Grace, where ſin is yet ſtanding, and the Soul taken captive therewith, which I had often ſought peace therein to my ſelf, but could not inherit liberty to my Soul any other way but as it came to be purified in obedience through the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And this work was not wrought in me by the knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh, but as I came to learn him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for ſpiritual wickedneſs had taken my Soul captive, and by the Spirit it muſt be ſanctified and ſet free. And I came to ſee that if I had been in his company here on earth as long as his Diſciples were in the fleſh, and ſeen as much as they did, and heard from his own mouth, I ſhould have been ſhort of this work as they were, in whom the Child was unborn when he went away in the fleſh, and they knew not what Spirits they were of, until he came again to them in Spirit and was revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them; then could they preach the Reſurrection of the dead and the Souls Redemption, and deſired to know him no more after the fleſh, when once they had received him in Spirit, but Preached Chriſt within the Hope of Glory, who till then looked for an outward kingdom and glory, until they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:154301:8"/> his promiſe, He that dwelleth with you ſhall be in you, I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come unto you; the world ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me, and becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo; at that day ye ſhall know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you, And this was his promiſe, whom they received, whom the world ſeeth no more, whoſe expectations are carnal, neither can any ſee the Kingdom of Heaven but who are born of this Spirit and Heirs of this Life, and he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life, but the wrath of God abides upon him whatever he may ſay he believes, and none hath the Son but as they receive this Spirit, and are led by this Spirit, and born thereof. And this I found alſo, that this Son of God doth not appear in any within or without, but as he conforms them to his own Image, which he hath alwayes born in this world, as ſaith the Scripture, When he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, who ſhall change our vile bodies and make them like his glorious body, from glory to glory by the ſame Spirit; And herein we have boldneſs in the day of Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he is ſo are we in this preſent world; and this is not obtained with thoughts of believing without, but by a lively working Power, which works out the earthly image and nature, and conforms to the heavenly in that ſpiritual birth which is not of fleſh and blood, nor could fleſh and blood ever diſcern it in whom it was, but ever hated it in whom it hath appeared in all ages; Which is of a ſhining nature where it is begotten of the Father, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid where it is formed, but by his fruits gives light to the world contrary to the worlds wayes, ſhowing of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Judgement againſt the deeds of darkneſs; And this heavenly begetting of the Father is to be holden forth in that clear Image of the Father, according to every ſeveral mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as he grows therein without mixture, that all may ſee that he is not of this world, who alſo takes them out of this world as he grows in any or they in him, forth of the world they muſt go bearing his reproach, that the Scriptures may be fulfilled, they are not of this world, even as I am not of this world, and this is the worlds light and condemnation, even his coming. And ſo I find that Faith which joyns to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:154301:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> world where it is, and doth not overcome the world, is not the faith of Chriſt, nor layes hold on the Power of Chriſt, though Faith may believe the Hiſtory of the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, which faith ſets not up the Kingdom of God in the heart, and caſts out the world there; that faith ſaves not the Soul from the pollution of the world through luſt, and ſo is but a conceit of Salvation and not the Power of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as ſaith the Scriptures, Whoſoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the world, even your Faith; and the faith which works not thus, is like a body without a ſpirit which is dead; But the living Faith that ſtands in Chriſt Jeſus, that Spirit puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart and Conſcience, and makes toward God in Chriſt the example in all good things, overcoming what ever would let the appearance of Chriſt in his temple, or hinder the bringing forth his vertues which is believed to be in him, to the utmoſt of what ever he hath received of the Father for ſuch believers, who believes not in a lye, but in the Truth and Power of God as it is in Chriſt Jeſus, and hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scriptures, not for a diſcourſe, but for an inheritance of life, of whoſe fulneſs we all receive according to our Faith, till his coming and we be compleat in him, and he in us; and ſo not come ſhort of the Glory of God, the end of our Faith and Converſation, that to the world he may be manifeſt in life and power to be the ſame that ever he hath been, though he have appeared in ſeveral forms in the fleſh, yet one in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to make up a compleat body.</p>
            <p>And therefore we find thoſe who were of this Faith witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt preſent (which the worlds faith could never receive under any form or profeſſion, but counted it blaſphemy, and that ſpirit the ſpirit of the Devil) And ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> witneſſed this Child born to them that ſo believed in his time, who was the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, &amp;c. whoſe Name they knew to be <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and this was before he appeared in that Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> was called the Son of man before that time alſo; and
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he was revealed in him, and ſpoke in him and wrought in him, and in his fleſh that which was behind of the afflictions of Chriſt was to be filled up for his bodies ſake which is the Church, and to whom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:154301:9"/> he forgave any thing in his time, he forgave it in the perſon of Chriſt; and many more might be noted who confeſſed the ſame Chriſt in them preſent, both before and after his time at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which Teſtimony could never be received (by the wiſdom of the world) in his Temples, before nor then, nor ſince to this day, for the god of this world being King in the heart, and having blinded the eye of the mind that ſhould ſee his ſpiritual Glory through the light of the Goſpel, he perſwades the world that he is either paſt or to come, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſent; and as many as are brought to confeſs him before men find it ſo at this day, who are hated of all men for his Names ſake, that the Scriptures may be fulfilled, and his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony finiſhed.</p>
            <p>And this Faith which confeſſeth him preſent, is that which the world cannot bear nor receive, who will preach him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at a diſtance, what he was and will be, but this faith cannot reach his coming at preſent in any meaſure to grow to his appearance now, nor will this faith ever give an entrance into his Kingdom upon earth, nor the holy reſt, nor is this the Faith of Chriſt (that puts him thus afar off) which fills with all the fulneſs of God.</p>
            <p>And by what I have learned, this is clear to me for ever without any more Controverſie, That the faith that admits of ſin is not Chriſts Faith, nor hath any ſhare or poſſeſſion in him; that faith which is not holy came not from God, and ſo cannot build up to God; that is not ſaving Faith that doth not ſave from ſins, but is deceiving faith which deceives the Soul, and ſuffers luſt to defile it and deſtroy it, and ſo brings it under Condemnation, by believing lyes, and ſo letting in ſin upon the Soul by conſent, perſwading that it cannot be otherwiſe; and ſo gives the Devil victory and the world vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and the fleſh victory and ſin victory over the Soul, which ſhould give the Soul victory over all; And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deceit can there be to the Soul then this is? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for ever that which I have ſeen and learned do I declare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that this is the deceiving faith, indeed rather unbelief then the Faith of Chriſt, which makes way for the god of this world to reign and act in things contrary to the life of Chriſt in the Creature, and the life of the Soul; and that faith
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154301:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> which gives way to the leaſt ſin is not the Faith of Chriſt, whoſe work and comings is to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and redeem the Soul from ſin, and the leaſt meaſure of that Faith that ſtands in his life overcomes the world and ſin in that meaſure; and he that commits ſin goes out of that Faith and acts againſt it; And a lying faith I have found that to be which perſwades the Soul of freedom from Condemnation, but gives it not freedom from ſin which is the cauſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and all ſhall witneſs this with me now or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that where ſin hath power there death hath power, and the grave and hell and condemnation hath power alſo, for theſe are the wages of ſin, then ſhall you ſay you were deceived who believed the contrary; And may not ſuch truly be ſaid to be paſt feeling indeed, who can commit ſin and feel no Condemnation for it already? And this is the effect of their falſe faith, to harden themſelves againſt the faithful witneſs of God in their own Conſcience, and the ſeared Conſcience hath made ſhip wrack of the Faith Chriſt, and the doctrine of Devils preaches the faith of Devils to give way to the works of the Devil, which all ſin is from the leaſt to the greateſt, and he that pleads for it is a father to it, and he that commits it a ſervant, and may look for the wages thereof if he repent not, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he believe the contrary.</p>
            <p>And many may feel this Truth at this day, who have a long time believed with this faith, deceiving their own ſouls day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day, believing they ſhall not be condemned, when they are condemned already in their own hearts, and feel the weight of ſin daily preſſing their Souls, and burthening the pure Conſcience, and the fear of death and ſin keeps their Souls ſtill in bondage, and lyes upon them all their lives, and yet they will force themſelves to believe contrary to Holy Faith and a good Conſcience that they are ſaved and redeemed, and thus make ſhip wrack of ſaving Faith and a good Conſcience, by believing a lye contrary to their own daily feeling, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to encourage them therein but this perſwaſion, which ſutes well with ſuch as take pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, which perſwaſion comes not of God, but condemned by that of God in themſelves; and this is the ſtate of many at this day, though ſome there be whoſe Conſcience are ſeared, and <pb n="18" facs="tcp:154301:10"/> feel not this witneſs living in them, though their damnation ſlumbereth not, though they have loſt their Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alſo.</p>
            <p>And this have I learned in Chriſt, that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference both in effect and nature betwixt that Faith which is the gift of God, and that faith which men make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for that which is the gift of God is of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, clean, pure and perfect as are all his gifts, and ſo it works naturally the Work and Will of God in all who receive it freely and mix nothing with it to darken it or ſtop his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by this Faith I am ſaved from ſin and condemnation, and begotten to the Father thereof in Chriſt Jeſus, which Faith is not of my ſelf but is the gift of God, to perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fight of God, and what ever is done in this Faith is not ſin, and whatſoever is againſt this Faith or not of this Faith is ſin, and brings Condemnation, and this Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves not of it; And if I act nothing doubtingly nor againſt this holy Faith, in this Faith I am juſtified in my own heart, and my own Conſcience kept clean, and I approved in Gods ſight, and I have boldneſs through the obedience of Faith in the day of Judgement, that it is not my own work but the righteouſneſs of Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, and this effect hath ſaving working Faith, and this is its Nature and Grace.</p>
            <p>But another faith I have found which is not ſo in nature or effect, being not freely received from above, but is fained and hath its ground here below, and its ends alſo; The earthly man in his wiſdom from the letter, reaſon or comprehenſions, ſets up an opinion or Image in his mind touching God or Chriſt, or Religion, Worſhip, Doctrine or Manners, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and then looking upon the likelineſs of it in the reaſoning part, gathers ſtrength to believe it muſt needs be ſo, and ſo forms a faith in himſelf; And though this faith be not perfect when he hath formed it and made it with all his ſtrength, but many things in Scriptures and the practiſe of the Saints (but eſpecially that of God in his own Conſcience will not ſute with it) yet the ſtrong man being above in the ſtrength of his Comprehenſion, forceth a Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe, and cauſes all to bow under it; ſo this faith brings not forth the birth of Chriſt, nor

            <p>And only this pure Faith which works towards the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt in all actions and ſufferings, is that which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all things in their place and time, and fits all Relations for his appearance therein to glorifie God, for God is not glorified in any thing upon Earth but in which the Son ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, who is the expreſs Image and Glory of God, and in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154301:11"/> whom alone he Reveals himſelf and the glory of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Mercy, the Grace and Truth of God is in his face in whom ever he appears; And ſo every meaſure of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Faith works towards the heavenly appearance, and the earthly faith to the earthly appearance; And ſo Faith in God is that which works effectually by love to the Image and Life of God in this world, which is ſeen onely in his ſpiritual beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which being believed in and ſet above, ſhines forth in every meaſure ſhewing the vertue and glory of the Spirit of God; but the fained earthly faith admits of ſome earthly thing in the heart for its end, in love to which it works diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Spirit, and ſo comes ſhort of the glory of God, for it cannot hold forth the fruits of the Spirit to glorifie God with an earthly lover in the heart, nor can one faith ſerve God and Mammon; ſo he that loves the things of this world is Gods enemy, whoſe faith withſtands the appearance of Chriſt in his actions or ſufferings, and ſo withſtands the glory of God which therein ſhould be manifeſt to all men, and this is that faith which ever of old hath put him afar off, yet gets the form and words to withſtand the life and vertue; And of this ſort they are of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, having a form of godlineſs, but deny the power of godlineſs, who ever was the greateſt enemies to the coming of Chriſt, being not of the Faith of Chriſt, nor of the Spirit of Chriſt, but being from below, withſtands his coming from above to be brought forth in his vertue, or worſhipped in his Spirit; this is Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>And this ſpirit and this faith it is that wreſts the Scriptures to ſeduce from Chriſt, and deſtroy the way of his coming; and to that end what Chriſt really Commands to be brought forth of his life and vertue in real appearance, this ſpirit ſerves himſelf with a meaning, inſtead of ſerving Chriſt with real actual obedience; And ſo his birth is a meaning inſtead of the life of Chriſt, and this he ſets to oppoſe that life, leaſt it ſhouldd be born into the world; as for inſtance, when Chriſt faith in Scriptures, Him that ſmiteth thee on the one cheek offer him the other, and him that ſues thee and takes thy coat, forbid him not thy cloak alſo, and him that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy goods ask them not again, reſiſt not evil, but but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome <pb n="21" facs="tcp:154301:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> evil with good, and love them that hate you, and many ſuch like Commands which Chriſt means really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and led an example in himſelf; and who ever receives the ſame Spirit, it moves to the ſame things as it grows in any, and being obeyed will bring forth the ſame fruits, to glorifie the Father thereof to all Generations, which Spirit waxeth not old, nor in its fruits barren, where it is really received in the Faith thereof and obeyed. But faith this other faith in the earthly ſpirit, Chriſt did not mean as he ſpoke, you muſt not take him litterally, thoſe words muſt have a ſpiritual meaning; and this ſpiritual meaning of his is to devour the life of this obedience both in Letter of Chriſt and Spirit of Chriſt, and to ſet up a ſubtle meaning without the life of Chriſt and contrary to his example, and this he will have to take place in all, both againſt the plain words of Chriſt his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in his walking, and the working of his Spirit in others; &amp; if he cannot deſtroy this faith and fruit before it be brought forth, then his work is to render him a high Blaſphemer, in whom this Child is born and brought forth to light, and counts it high preſumption for any to witneſs the life of Chriſt in them by bringing it forth into the world, yet himſelf will preach Chriſt in him, and the Life of Chriſt in him, and the Spirit of Chriſt in him, and his body the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, &amp;c. becauſe he finds theſe words in Scripture; but if any worſhip in that Temple ſo as to believe and obey unto life openly, that he cannot own without a meaning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, and ſo he ſets the form to deny the Power, and Chriſts Words he wreſts to deny his coming; And how long this faith hath profeſſed him to come (and his Life and Glory at his coming) in its own carnal Comprehenſions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may witneſs: but is never like to receive him in the ſame Life and Spirit and Power in which he ever appeared, and ſo to that generation is he ever to come, but never preſent, further then to make a cover for ſins paſt and preſent, and an encouragement for ſin to come; and thus the devourer turns the beſt of things into a lye in all that believes him, that he may keep Chriſt and the Soul from their preſent union, which he could not long do but by conſent of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there being that of God in every one which daily draws <pb n="22" facs="tcp:154301:12"/> towards him, where it is not quenched by believing lies, whereby ſuch as receive not the Truth in the love of it comes to be damned, as it was in the dayes of old, and a ſtrait paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage I have found into the way of Truth and life, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all his ſubtle pretences, and I have ſeen his words true who faith. Few there be that find it, the enemy being every way ready to meet them that ſeek with a ſhadow, meaning, or ſome deceit to believe in ſtead of the ſubſtance, handling the Words of God deceitfully, uſing the gifts of God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the life of the giver, and turning grace into lacivious liberty.</p>
            <p>And thus have I learned in the light of the world, that in my turning towards him at his reproof when I knew him not, and believing in his light whom I had not ſeen, I found that Faith given which did declare the righteouſneſs of God in him, wherein he perfectly walked upon earth, both in doing and ſuffering, which being turned towards, I found the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation that God had ſent forth, through faith in his blood to declare his righteouſneſs for the remitting of my ſins paſt, that God might be juſt, who could not have paſt by my ſins paſt, had he not accepted his ſufferings, nor I have had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſin paſt to have followed him, nor could I have been accepted therein, but in the faith and hope of the ſame righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; ſo God was full in juſtifying, and his forbearance magnified towards me therein, and in turning to this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his declared in the light of faith and hope, my face was ſet towards Gods righteouſneſs in Chriſt Jeſus to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for life and ſalvation for time to come to walk in, and ſo being turned towards God, all my ſins paſt was behind me, and Gods righteouſneſs before me, and ſo from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth was I to be found in Gods righteouſneſs walking in a meaſure of it, and in the faith and hope of the fulneſs of Chriſt and attainment of God for mine inheritance. And this great Redemption I found in Chriſt Jeſus at that day was in ſuch things as theſe following; As firſt his calling of me with his light, his holding forth to me his life and ſuffering, which was ſo holy that I could not but confeſſe to them, his turning me towards the ſame in hope thereof by believing, his begetting a mind in me towards that ſame life, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <pb n="23" facs="tcp:154301:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> of his light that way to lead me, and the ſetting of me free from the wrath of God for all my ſins of ignorance paſt, which elſe had laid upon me as a weight or chain, binding me that I could not have walked the way of his light, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I do not ſay, that if I turned to commit ſin again, that that ſin was caſt behind my back alſo, I learned otherwiſe, I found that ſin then before my face greater then the reſt, and ſtood in my way to God, and ſtopt me from following his light or growing in his life that I could no way eſcape it but by repenting of it, and receiving the juſt ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my ſelf, and bearing his indignation, till he that wounded me for it healed me again, which I never found but as I turned from the evil with my whole heart, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the puniſhment till the Advocate did ariſe to interced, whoſe blood I had trampled on, and whoſe precious life I had pierced, and his holy Spirit grieved, by turning away from his leadings.</p>
            <p>Nor do I ſay that all my ſins which formerly I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, of which I had been convinced by the light of the world, when I was in the world before I believed it to be ſufficient, that they was wholly taken away as my ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was, for this I found that God in this was juſt and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, merciful in that he did not lay them all at once before me leaſt they ſhould have preſt me down that I could not have followed the light nor gotten any ſtrength, but muſt needs have periſhed under them had he not ſpared. And juſt I have found him alſo; for as they were not committed all at once againſt the light of his Spirit, ſo he hath at one time or other viſited for them, and laid them before me, yet not all at once, nor no way ſo heavy as thoſe committed after I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and gave up my ſelf to follow the light, and yet to an account he hath brought me for them; And coming to feel the terrours of God, I have learned to fear, and love, and have found the ground and riſe and deceits of that Faith that believes Chriſt to have taken away the ſins of believers paſt preſent and to come, with which many at this day make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the witneſs of God, and the juſt ſlain in them, and that Scripture I have learned without a meaning, if we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the Truth there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154301:13"/> looking for of judgement and fiery indignation to devour the adverſary, though none know how but he that comes to it, in the fulfilling, and then ſhall be ſeen he thats born of God ſins not, and he that believes is born of God, but he that ſins turns his back both on the Faith and birth thats towards Chriſt, and becomes adverſe thereunto in his work what ever he ſayes he believes, and this I have found an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth what ever men believe or imagine, that no longer then a man keeps his face towards the light of God, no longer is his ſins caſt behind his back, whether they be ſins paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to come, but if he turn from Gods righteouſneſs, his own iniquities will riſe and meet him, both new and old, and in vain doth ſuch believe they are then blotted out of Gods ſight, whoſe oye ſhewes him his way in which he then walks and condemns him for it in his own heart.</p>
            <p>Nor was the ground and root of ſin-removed ſo ſoon as my mind was turned by the light from ſin towards God, but the motions thereof I found, and the luſt ſeeking to go forth to its objects, to bring in to conceive ſin again afreſh; That ground was but removed as I grew in Chriſt and he in me, and as I came to learn him that was in the beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin was, who was learned in faithful following and ſerving of his Spirit, in watching in Faſtings in Prayers, and in all ſpiritual wreſtlings, as I came to be led into with the light, in which Warfare I came to ſee the hardſhip of him that will be a ſouldier of Chriſt Jeſus, and the baptiſms into his death, the ſlothful ſervant and the faithful, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and the Parables and figures of the Kingdom opened, as that Spirit grew in me which interprets the Scriptures in the life and opens the ſealed myſteries thereof in their ſeaſon, as they come to be fulfilled, and ſo I came to the gift of the Scriptures by inſpiration, which onely profits to the perfecting of the man of God, which the man of this world not having learned, wreſts to his own deſtruction, getting the words of them in the earthly part, before they be fulfilled in his heart through the Spirit, and ſuch receive them not by inſpiration, nor the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And in this journey I have ſeen the ſlothful ſervant over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with a fault which he had once caſt behind him, and never intended to joyn to again, of which the diligent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <pb n="25" facs="tcp:154301:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> is kept free, and I have ſeen the wages of each ſervant according to his diligence in that which he hath of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted in him, and not by his own ſtrivings in the thoughts of himſelf, his worth or wiſdom; And in diligent hearkening and obeying of the Spirit have I found the right faithfulneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, though getting knowledge be highly eſteemed with men, and I have found that as I have the Spirit mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in me to profit withal, ſo the times of my profiting is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his hand, and my waitings upon him when he moves not is my reaſonable ſervice, and a profiting time to me as if he moved, though I ſee it not, and this I found a great croſs to my haſty will, which indeed is the true worſhip in Spirit, which when I knew not this Spirit to hearken and bow to, and obey and obſerve in all things as his will leads, I worſhipped I knew not what, and my fear towards God then was taught by the precepts of men, and I was not taught of the Lord, not being born of that Spirit; and ſo all the children of the Lord are taught of the Lord, and as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the Sons of God, theſe Scriptures I then could read and underſtand without meanings, not by that which my wiſdom taught me, but which the Holy Ghoſt taught me, and the Scriptures thus learned and received was no more a notion to be loſt, but a poſſeſſion, and I came to have an inheritance therein amongſt them that are ſanctified in all ages, &amp; no ſubtle man could either ſteal them or change them, or any way beguil me of the Truth of them by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, nor take away my comfort I had in them, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and fellowſhip therein being in the ſame Spirit and life that gave them forth, and the Word of God thus grew and endureth for ever, and the Spirit of truth that leads into all truth endures for ever, and the Seed of God is one therein to all generations, and that is one which perfects the Spirits of all Juſt men, and God himſelf is Judge over all, and leader of all by his own begettings in all that enter into this reſt of the faithful, which remains to all his children, out of which falſe Faiths and diſobedience ſhuts themſelves.</p>
            <p>And that which declares the righteouſneſs of God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins paſt, and for an inheritance againſt ſin for time to come, have I found to be Faith without falſhood, <pb n="26" facs="tcp:154301:14"/> which Righteouſneſs though in the Faith and Hope beyond declaring, yet inherited but as the vertues that are in Chriſt Jeſus comes to be received in the life of them. And that faith which hath not that Righteouſneſs for its ground and end, and the vertues and ſeveral meaſures of the growth of Chriſt for its life and increaſe, That I have found upon tryal to be a fained fancy after mans mind and not after Gods meaſures: And he that ſaith he hath Faith in God and is without the hope of this Righteouſneſs for his inheritance, Or ſaith he hath Chriſt further then he hath his Virtues for his life and growth towards this inheritance, when he comes to be weighed with Truth, will be found too light to ſtand in Judgement or abide the fire, or to dwell with everlaſting burnings; The try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of that Faith will leave him without Faith, then ſhall it be read as it is written, <hi>When the Son of man comes, ſhall he find Faith on the Earth?</hi>

If you chuſe after the fleſh, then you ſet the vail betwixt you and the Lord, and Gods Kingdom and his Image you cannot ſee, and ſo you reject the Lord as other Nations do; but if you <pb n="31" facs="tcp:154301:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> look through the Vail unto that which is within the Vail, then ſhall the vail be taken away from all your hearts, and you ſhall ſee him amongſt you whom you wait for, and him alone ſet up and worſhip, and chuſe him alone to reign over you who is near you, at hand to all that put not his day afar off.</p>
               <p>So if you make Rulers like all the Nations, then after the fleſh, they that are rich, they that are proud, they that are full of earthly glory, &amp;c. Here is the earth ſet above, then the Vail is before your eye and you ſee not the Lord, that Spirit, nor do you ſet up Jeſus to be Lord by the Holy Ghoſt; But if that eye be open in you, that can ſee through the Vail of earth, and all this deal of fleſh and darkneſſe to that which is within the Vail, even the Holy One in his Temple, him to chuſe and ſet above in your minds; Then your eye ſhall ſee the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed and the King in his Glory, and he ſhall rule whoſe right it is in every heart, and your Governous ſhall be of your ſelves, and all violence ſhall ceaſe, and ſhakings of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Government being upon his ſhoulders who is the Prince of all your peace, in the great &amp; in the ſmall, who ſhall reign in righteouſneſſe, and judge the people with equity for God and not for rewards, to whoſe authority every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue confeſſe for conſcience ſake, his Name being written in every heart will then be read, whoſe Kingdom is everlaſting, and in ſpirit and power he reigns, and in ſpirit is worſhipped in Heaven and in Earth, who fills all things with the preſence of his Glory, and his Kingdom is near to all that can believe, <hi>its within you</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and he rules where he is not known (though not to ſalvation) who is made of the Seed of
<hi>David</hi> after the fleſh by the Word of God to all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, a King for ever according to promiſe, whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the eye which the God of this World hath blinded is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting afar off, who ſees not the Light of his Glorious Goſpel though he be not afar off, but him in whom all things have life and being, either to ſalvation or condemnation, and this is the condemnation that light is come already into the World, which men who loves their evil deeds ſay is to come, and ſo looks for that without who is a Spirit within, and therein hath ever reigned more or leſſe, but now is ariſing to his day over all the World, whoſe ſound is gone out to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154301:17"/> ends of the earth, and his light ariſeth in every heart, to life or condemnation, and ſome it leads into reſt, and others it pricks to the heart, and they kick againſt it and will not have it to rule therein, and to this day he is rejected of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who is the firſt born unto God in Spirit bleſſed over all.</p>
               <p>And now all ſorts of people who in truth wait for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God upon earth, with that which in you is of him, you may all ſee (if you keep that eye ſingle) when he draws near who is born of the Spirit, and when he is put afar off in his Government here below, when you behold in any manner of Authority, ſuch a ſpirit as is for God alone, looking to that of God in every man without reſpect of perſon or riches, and with a ſingle eye ſeeks to find out where that meaſure of God is tranſgreſſed in any, or where it is oppreſſed by any, and with that meaſure of God in himſelf ſeeks to ſet judgement upon the head of the tranſgreſſor, and to ſet free the innocent principle of God in all, which will not lead any to evil, then is the judgement of God and for God, and that of God is ſet above in all, that's he that's born of God; here the Kingdom of God is near, and as this increaſes ſo God draws near, and his Kingdom increaſes, and that of God in you all will anſwer thereto, and rejoyce thereat which waits for him, and that which is upright in every heart ſhall ſay that is the Judgement of God, and in that Veſſel is God on his Throne, according to the meaſure of that Spirit ſet up in Judgement, ſo is Jeſus Lord by the holy Ghoſt, known and bowed to.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, in what place of Authority ſoever it be, in which the Innocent comes for Judgement againſt the Oppreſſor who is too ſtrong for him, and ſo ſeeks to juſtice to plead his Cauſe and to deliver the ſeed of God that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened; And when he comes his Cauſe is not heard but is thruſt away (if not further enſnared becauſe he cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that of God in him more, either by bowing to ſomething of vain Cuſtoms or Worſhips never ſet up by God, nor owned by his witneſs for Conſcience ſake; Or elſe becauſe he cannot fire his judgement by feeding a Covetous Spirit which is for Rewards and not for God that he Judges, and ſo the Innocent <pb n="33" facs="tcp:154301:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſoul is not relieved at this throne, but ſent away as an of fender, from that place where he ſhould be eaſed and juſtified with the judgement of a free ſpirit, for juſtice ſake, doth not that of God in you all teſtifie againſt this, that judgement is here turned backward in that veſſel, and that Juſus is not Lord therein? ſo the innocent heart is ſadned but not ſaved, and the Kingdom of God put afar off, and the Scepter of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs not ſeen.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Rulers and People, who ſet up fleſh in ſtead of the holy ſpirit to rule over you, the wills of men, the pride and glory of this world, or any viſible thing here below born after the fleſh; ſee what you chuſe and what you put afar off; and with that ſpirit you now chuſe you will never ſee the Kingdom of God, nor be able to ſay in truth that Jeſus is Lord; Its by the ſpirit of holineſs meekneſs and true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and works of righteouſneſs that Jeſus is known to Reign, and therein ſtands the ſight of his Kingdom and Lordſhip, in every heart, in every Court, and in every place of judgement to all generations, which you deny in chuſing the man of this world after the fleſh to rule in you or over you therein; And yet you ſay you look for him, and thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come delay, but deny him in the ſimplicity of his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit to rule for his own in all, as all your Rulers ever did, as you have read in words and now may read in deeds, the world by wiſdom knows not God, ſo that ſpirit chuſes its own to rule, but cannot receive him whom you ſay you look for.</p>
               <p>And how ſhould any one who ſees the Kingdom of God, and where the ſimplicity of Chriſt is above, own that Kingdom, or worſhip that ſpirit and not betray the ſimplicity of Chriſt and give his honour to another. And if in the meekneſs of mind you did but weigh this, you could not think it ſo ſtrange why ſo many at this day (who have received the Kingdom of God in his lowly juſt and righteous ſpirit) chuſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death under that ſpirit of this world then to bow to worſhip it, or confeſſe that due thereto which belongs onely to Jeſus the Lord, neither would you ſay it was obſtinacy or contempt of Authority rather to ſuffer by the will of man then to rob <pb n="34" facs="tcp:154301:18"/> the Lord of his glory &amp; deny Chriſt in his Kingly office, and ſet up another in his place. And herein true wiſdom may ſee that in ſo doing we reſiſt not that power which is ordained of God, nor the perſon, but that ſpirit we teſtifie againſt by ſufferings under, which God never annointed for a Saviour, holding forth the annointing as we have received for a witneſs againſt him, in the ſpirit of meekneſs, confeſſing our King in whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power to ſuffer; ſo to us he is come and by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt we can ſay he is Lord, therefore to us there is but one Lord, though there be many ſo called whether in heaven or in earth, yet have we but one in all, both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and him we know where ever he is by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and to him in ſpirit we confeſſe and bow, and the fruits of his ſpirit are manifeſt with the light of the world, teſtifying againſt all the works of darkneſs in all the children of his Kingdom. And to us he is born who is from above the holy Child, wonderful in Councel and ſtrength, whoſe heavenly power and vertue takes our affections from all earthly objects and worſhip, whoſe name is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and it is written in our hearts, and ſhed abroad into the world in our lives, and Chriſt Jeſus is the end of our converſation, him alone to put on, above all to Preach by walking in him as we have received of that lively image of holineſs and Truth, the annointed of God, and ſo we confeſſe him before men, who is the right Heir, in what veſſel ſoever he appears, and the prayers we give to God where this treaſure is found in the earthen veſſel, and the hope of all our glory is Chriſt within, and the increaſe of his Government is Chriſt within, of which there is no end, and with that ſpirit is all righteouſneſs eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the Kingdom of God upon earth, and Eternal life.</p>
               <p>And where this is not ſeen, choſen and followed, there men rule in their own wills, and where mens perſons and riches is reſpected in chuſing ſuch, there the ſame is reſpected in judgement by ſuch, and the Law of God is perverted, and the ſword of Juſtice which ſhould defend the cauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent is laid by, and the fiſt of wickedueſs lift up againſt that which is tender of God in every conſcience, and when this rules the righteous Seed mourns in ſecret, but wickedneſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154301:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> reigns openly; And this is and ever was the ſtate of the Kingdom of God and the Kingdoms of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the one rules in the Spirit of Holineſs, and the other exerciſe Lordſhip in their own wills, choſen and ſet up not by the Holy Ghoſt, as you may read in the Scriptures concerning <hi>Iſraels</hi> common wealth, who when they wanted the ruling of this ſpirit they ſold themſelves under their enemies, but when this was their Judge they had a Saviour choſen after the ſpirit, not after the fleſh, what ever was the veſſel, the Spirit was their Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was a poor wandring Shepheard, yet in this Spirit a God to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and Saviour of <hi>Iſrael; Samuel</hi> a poor man who received no reward for judgement, and when they went about to chuſe another after the manner of other Nations they rejected God, who then gave them a King in his wrath; <hi>David</hi> a poor man not choſen by the outward appearance as man looks, but by the heart, by the direction of the Spirit, he was the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his ſeed of the ſame Election hath the everlaſting Kingdom of promiſe to all generations.
<hi>Eliſha</hi> a plowman, yet by that Spirit was he the Chariots of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and horſmen thereof. <hi>Deborah</hi> a woman yet a Judge &amp; deliverer to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And too long would it be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in all ages how he hath ſet up his throne and ſaved his people in this Election, not of wiſdom, riches or worldly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the poor of this world, rich in Faith, heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of promiſe, which you ſay you look for, but cannot ſee nor receive while you chuſe after the fleſh as the world hath ever done, who ſtill have bent all their wiſdom and Religion to keep the Heir out of his Kingdom, whom they have been looking for after the fleſh, but not believing in the light to give them a fight through the vail to him that is born of the Spirit have reſiſted the Holy One, and choſen the murtherer, as did your fathers ſo do you alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, and as it was ſo it is, that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and chuſes after the fleſh and worſhips after the fleſh, for it can ſee no further, it cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit, and chuſes after the ſpirit, and worſhips in ſpirit, and theſe are contrary Kingdoms, and he thats born after the fleſh perſecutes him thats born after the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:154301:19"/> ſpirit, ever did and ever will do, for the Scripture cannot be broken, which hath ſo ſaid and is now fulfilled.</p>
               <p>And now you that are called Chriſtians, you read and Preach of this King Chriſt Jeſus and his Kingdom, what a One he ever hath been in his appearance upon Earth, by whom he hath been received and by whom rejected and after what manner he hath ever ſuffered, and by what power he hath reigned in all ages, and this you will confeſſe in words, but will you now receive him to reign in you? Or can you own his appearance where it is ſet up in others and not be offended therewith, is that eye open that knows him, or can you delight in him who was never like the world in his walkings? was not he ever poor as to this world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejected of the rich and learned? lowly, and rejected of Princes and them that was high? was not his work ever to change ſhadows, and forms, and Religious traditions ſet up in mens minds above the life of Truth and leadings of the ſpirit, and to ſet up ſpiritual worſhip and obedience in its place? And therefore by the builders ever rejected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and his new work was ever fooliſhneſs to the wiſe, wherefore he bare the reproach thereof with patience; was he not ever meek and innocent and harmleſs in his converſation towards all men as a Lamb indeed, ſeperate from ſinners in life, yet ſeeking them to ſave out of ſin with the dayly giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his life, &amp;c? So he was and ſo he hath ever appeared on earth; now can you receive you King as he was you that wait for him? Or do you think he is changed? Is he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proud and lofty in fleſh after the world, cruel and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hard-hearted, ſubtle and crafty to deceive the ſimpie, ſtrong and violent to trample on the helpleſs, doth the glory of his Scepter now ſtand in meats and drinks and fine apparel or great earthly poſſeſſions? doth he now come to take up his abode and delight in theſe things, who ever hath come to take the minds of his people out of theſe things up into the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſure? doth he now delight in earthly glory, ſtrife and exaltation? Is the weapons of his Warfare now become carnal wherewith he overcomes his enemies? doth he now come with haling and beating, whips and priſons and cruel tortures to take the Kingdom of peace, who hath ſuffered ſuch things <pb n="37" facs="tcp:154301:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> formerly from the world himſelf, &amp; will he now turn oppreſſor of that which is tender in Conſcience, and grind the face of the poor, or pervert the Judgement of the needy? Should he now be ſeen in works of this nature, were this to appear the ſecond time without ſin unto Salvation as he is promiſed? Sure the vail is thick over that heart who ſees not that this is not his Kingdom, Power nor Glory, nor his Image who is the ſame yeſterday to day and for ever. Yet is this nature above in many, and choſen to Rule over many who ſay they wait for his Kingdom, that eye being darkned with the love of the world which ſhould give the true fight of his coming, the carnal mind thinks God to be like himſelf; But did you but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly look into your own hearts, with that eye which puts a difference between things that differ in your ſelves, to know each motion of each Spirit, and each power, and the end and nature of its working, the earthly and the heavenly, you would ſoon be able to Judge of theſe two which ſo far differ in their fruits, and are ſo contrary in all things, and to own the right heir in his Kingdom; But while you ſuffer the god of this world to keep his throne in your hearts, by letting him captivate your minds and affections into earthly delights, it is not like he will ſuffer you to chuſe aright, nor receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to reign in you or over you; the eye of the minde being blinded therewith, the light of the Goſpel cannot ſhine into the heart by which you ſhould chuſe, and which gives the knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus, nor that treaſure be ſeen or received in the earthen veſſel, as King either in your ſelves or others; but the wiſe in heart knows what they wait for, and when they ſee him they rejoyce with the joy of his Kingdom which conſiſts not in carnal things, nor comes with outward obſervations, but whoſe coming is within, and whoſe Kingdom conſiſts in Righteouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, bleſſed be our King for ever, and bleſſed are they who put not his Kingdom afar off.</p>
               <p>And therefore you Rulers and People of all ſorts high and low, this word is to you, and this day is to you the day of the Lord, ariſe and receive your King into his Kingdom, that he may receive you and eſtabliſh you therein; the Lord is at hand, he is near to all that call upon him in truth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:154301:20"/> To you Princes, Judges, Juſtices, Mayors and Conſtables &amp; all ſorts of Rulers who are in the place to Govern, the Lord is at hand, he is near you all, the Kingdom of God is within you, the Principle of God is within you, with which (if you mind it) he will break the yoak of the oppreſſor within you and without you by the ſword of Juſtice, that's his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon earth, put it not afar off; let it ariſe in your hearts, ſet it up above the will of man, let it ſhine in your hearts, let it ſpeak in your Courts, that which is of God in you all, which Judges juſtly and with equity; lay by your will, your pride, your covetouſneſs, and all that's above that Spirit of meekneſs in your minds, and make room in your hearts for the Holy Ghoſt, that thereby Jeſus may be Lord in you and over others, that you may know him to whom Judgement belongs, to be in you; you need not ſay who ſhall aſcend into Heaven to bring down Chriſt from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep to bring up Chriſt again from the dead, for he is nigh you, and you may feel his witneſs in Spirit, and his Word is in your hearts, the Word of Faith, the Word of Righteouſneſs, that therewith you may all know him, who ſtandeth in the Congregation of the mighty, to Judge among the Gods, who Judges not unjuſtly, nor accepteth the perſon of the wicked, but that with him you may deliver the Poor and Fatherleſs, and Judge the cauſe of the Stranger, wherein they are oppreſſed, that's his Kingdom, and that's the Word of Faith and the Word of Righteouſneſs that leads to it.</p>
               <p>And if this be ſet up in your own hearts to love it more then gifts and rewards, perſons or earthly glory, then is the Lord near you, and his Kingdom is above the earth in you, and your work will be to ſet it above the earth in others, and ſo the Kingdom of your Father who begets this in your hearts his Kingdom comes, as his Will is done upon earth as it is in Heaven, where all obey him, there is the Kingdom his, the Power is his by which you Judge, and the glory is his of your Righteous Judgement, now and for ever if you therein abide; And thus ſhall you be of the obedient Children to that of your Father in you begotten, who ſay and do, who pray and practiſe, and not like the Scribes and Phariſees and <pb n="39" facs="tcp:154301:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> Lawyers, who ſaid and did not, who made long prayers but devoured the poor and needy, and Judged not the cauſe of the ſtranger, but laid heavy burthens upon others, and bowed not thereto themſelves, who could not believe in the light, nor receive Chriſt within them, though he told them the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was within them, and his Word had no place in them, who was filled with pride and wilfulneſs; ſo they had loſt the Key of knowledge, the Key of
<hi>David,</hi> to open to them the way into annointing, whereby to know
<hi>Davids</hi> Lord to reign in Spirit, which hath the Promiſe of
<hi>Davids</hi> Throne for ever; So when they loſt this the Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Prieſthood alſo; and he ſet up his ſign to the Gentiles, preaching the Kingdom of God to them that were afar off, and they that were not a people came to the Kingdom of his annointing, and that great Myſtery that had been hid from ages was opened thereby to the Gentiles, which was Chriſt in them the Hope of Glory, and Kingdom of the Father.</p>
               <p>And now you that are called Chriſtians, and are making great Declarations, what a glorious Kingdom the Kingdom of Chriſt will be at his coming, and what holineſs and righteous Government, and many high things and great glory you look for, &amp;c. But above all the reſt how are you eſtranged, who are gone out again from the annointing to look for this without you, while you reject it within you? Was Chriſt within them that great Myſtery that had been hid from ages, which by the hearing of Faith was opened to the Gentiles, and was the Hope of Glory to them (even Chriſt within them, whom the Apoſtles preached, warning every man and teaching every man that they might preſent every one perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, the Hope of Glory within them, which Faith the Jews not receiving, loſt their King and Kingdom?) And is your hopes without you, as the Jews was? Is that the Hope the Apoſtles preached to the Gentiles, or that which enters within the vail? Is there not a vail drawn over your hearts again, whilſt you read this in Scriptures? And have not you loſt the Key of knowledge, who are gone out from the annointing in your hopes? Have you not loſt the Key of <hi>David,</hi> which ſhould <pb n="40" facs="tcp:154301:21"/> let you ſee <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, in which the Kingdom of God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed for ever? Did God ſwear this to
<hi>David</hi> after the fleſh, or to <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, or to any after the fleſh? Then how is his Kingdom everlaſting? Or why did he ſay the fleſh profits nothing? And why did the Apoſtle ſay, they deſired henceforth to know no man after the fleſh, no not Chriſt himſelf? Fleſh and blood paſſeth away, but this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is everlaſting; ſo him whom the Apoſtles preached in Spirit by the receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, wherein they were to grow up to his age and ſtature and appearance, him you reject in ſpirit to be the hope of your glory and kingdom, and wait for a Government after the fleſh, and ſo ſhut up the great Myſtery of godlineſs which was opened, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt your ſelves, which Myſtery is not after the fleſh, but God manifeſt in fleſh, Chriſt within the Hope of Glory, and this Myſtery was ever ſhut with carnal expectations, but opened in the Spirit, as it was ſo it is, who denies the Spirit to be Lord ſhuts up the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ariſe out of the fleſh you Rulers and People and receive your King, long hath he been rejected and thruſt out of the Throne of Judgement, for which you have no Peace nor Eſtabliſhment; Why will you not turn to him who calls you in Spirit, what a ſhame is this that you are called Chriſtians, and know not your annointing Chriſt in you? What Chriſtians and without Chriſt, Chriſt not come? What do you Rule withal, and diſcern with, and Judge with? Is not all that reprobate who knows not Chriſt in you? But if you know a Juſt, a Holy, a Righteous Principle of Spirit in you that is of Chriſt, ſet it up and you ſet up Chriſt, bow to the Holy Ghoſt and you worſhip in Spirit, and thereby you ſhall ſay that Jeſus is Lord, ſet up his light in your hearts and his day will ariſe to you all, for there muſt the day dawn and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts, which will give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God near you, and true Judgement near you, and that which Rules over ſpiritual wickedneſs near you, which all muſt bow to who receives the Kingdom of God, honour God in your hearts, ſet him up in your hearts, let him be Judge in your hearts, and firſt receive his Light and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="41" facs="tcp:154301:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> there, before you paſs Judgement upon others, leaſt you in judging others before men condemn your ſelves before God; <hi>David</hi> had little thought he had done that, when he ſaid, he that had taken his neighbours lamb ſhould ſurely dye; and you may ſoon do the like if you go out from the Spirit and Judge before you receive Judgement in your own hearts, and ſee all be clean there firſt, then is your Scepter eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs, and your Judgement in Truth, which is the Scepter of the Throne of <hi>David</hi> in Spirit, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>David</hi> in fleſh, and will condemn you in the fleſh if you ſin againſt it; and that is his Kingdom, and he is King for ever, who in Spirit condemns ſin in the fleſh, and for this end is he manifeſt, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in all who walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit, which comes in his Name who went away after the fleſh, that the kingdom might come. And if you receive your Authority and Judgement in this right Principle of God, it will Judge for God in all, your ſelves and others, and it will fit you to be Mediators betwixt the Offender and Sufferer in all, and you will ſee what it is which tranſgreſſeth and what is tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the nature of every offence to paſs an equal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accordingly, and this is of God and he loves it, and where that of God is preſſed not to clear the oppreſſor, but to Judge the oppreſſor, and ſet that of God which is innocent free; and here with that of God in your ſelves you Judge for that of God in all, and ſet that of God above the oppreſſor in all, which oppreſſor is not of God in you nor in others, but is to be Judged, and for the Law and for the Sword, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of God the Law is not; And here is Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom already near and not afar off, where God is all in all, and the Righteous reigns, and the power that is ordained of God, the Soul is ſubject to for Conſcience ſake towards God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; and that of God in every Conſcience ſhall anſwer to your Judgement and Authority, and God ſhall ſet you up therewith as a terrour in every heart above the evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer, the murtherer and traytor, and the arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſhall ſtick in the hearts of all that ſeek to undermine this Government, for the Kingdom of God it is, in which he

If he would Appeal to Juſtice, he cannot come at it, nor doth Judgement ſit in the Gate; Is there help in the Houſe of the King, or will the Houſe of the Prieſt plead his Right?

Alſo ſearch your Goſpel if you can receive his way therein which changes not, Did not he come in Chriſt, and in his Apoſtles as a wanderer to and fro, without a certain dwelling place, to Preach Repentance and amendment of life, and the light of the world, from City to Village, from place to place, which way you now call Vagabonds? And did not he enter their Temples and Synagogues, Schools and Markets, and all their Places of Worſhip and Concourſe where Sin or falſe Worſhip was acted, and there Diſputed and teſtified againſt their whole way, and called them to the way of God, and this was his manner of walking in them, even in times of their Worſhips, and in the greateſt Aſſembly of Meetings &amp; Markets, which to you is become as Gall and Wormwood, and you call it Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and Peace-breaking.</p>
               <p>Was not this his way in ſuch as knew their bodies to be his Temples, and in whom he walked and ſpoke the words of life, and judgement, and Truth; his way by which he overturned the World, leaving all without excuſe againſt the day of wrath which was to follow where he was rejected, his way by which <pb n="48" facs="tcp:154301:25"/> he called many thouſands out of falſe Worſhips in which they were ſettled (as you are) and their Souls deceived, but this was his way to Salvation, which was not their way (as he hath ſaid, my wayes are not your wayes) yet was there no other way for them to be ſaved, wch is the ſame at this day to all that receive his coming, and to all that reſiſt the Holy Spirit in his Temples, as did your fathers ſo do you ſaith <hi>Steven</hi> to ſuch as worſhipped God in outward obſervations, but denied his way and worſhip in Temples made without hands, theſe reſiſted the Spirit that ſpoke in his Saints, theſe reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, reſiſted the Way of God, as do you, read and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Steven</hi> was full of God, the Spirit ſpoke in him, they reſiſted him, they called him a Blaſphemer, they ſtoned him by a Law; here was Gods Way, and their way, now try your wayes whoſe work is to reſiſt the Spirit and Light within, which hath filled the hearts and mouths of his ſervants to cry againſt ſin; mind what you reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Had not God come in this his own Way to ſeek and to ſave by his appearance in ſuch veſſels as he had prepared of old for that end (whom in time he filled with himſelf, as they ſtood in need in all conditions to paſs with him through all hardſhips and crooked wayes of the wicked world, from place to place ſeeking a Seed to himſelf) what had become of the Saints of old, which was covered with darkneſs, till he came thus to appear to them holding forth his light, and his life and glory in veſſels prepared, to ſhew forth his vertues and the riches of his grace, not onely in declaring in words, but alſo in power to ſuffer for his Name long and hard Tryals, with much patience and meekneſs, in all which they became ſigns to the world, and lively witneſſes of God to his own in every Conſcience, whereby the Seed of God in many gathered ſtrength to ariſe out of darkneſs and come to Judgement, and by their ſufferings waxed confident in the Faith, that it was the eternal God that they had ſeen preached, and that was in them who thus ſuffered, and did not receive their words as the words of men, but of God who was with them and in them in all; And this his Way was not onely to receive ſuch as came to him, but with danger of life went in to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and publick places to bring them out of the claws of <pb n="49" facs="tcp:154301:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Devil, who beat ſome in their Synagogues, hailed ſome before Rulers, caſt ſome into Priſon, who ſuffered great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to bring ſouls from under this dark power, and in all this God was afflicted with them, and by his own Spirit brought them out, and this was his way of ranſoming and redeeming, and of bringing to
<hi>Zion</hi> as you may read of old; and thus by his Spirit and by his working in them did he work wonders and ſignes, and was a witneſſe againſt the whole Body of ſin, overturning falſe wayes and worſhips by a way they knew not, nor did the World know it was he until he had brought to paſs his work upon them, having thus gathered out his Seed from amongſt them, who then ſought to ſtop his way as you do at this day; and what was their end?</p>
               <p>And in this way was the Churches of Chriſt gathered even by blood and ſufferings, and tumults, and beatings, and mockings, and whipings, and all manner of cruel uſage, fighting with beaſts after the manner of men; and by the patient ſufferings of Chriſt in them were many reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the ſnares of the Devil, which had he not ſought them in this way, they had lived and died in blindneſſe; and this was the way in which God gathered the Churches, (which you who oppoſe this way would imitate) and in this way was the miſtery of Godlineſſe and the miſtery of iniquity reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Kingdom of Chriſt known upon earth, and in this way came the Scriptures of the Apoſtles and Prophets of which you talk, and would turn to oppoſe this way, like them who read his coming in the Prophets, and would have ſtopt his coming in Chriſt and the Apoſtles, ſo do you ever reſiſt the way of the Holy One, and yet in words you pray for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but having erred in your hearts from that light which ſhould give the knowledge of him, you know not his wayes, but have in your imaginations ſet a new way for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, every one in his own form, but all think you are doing him ſervice to ſtop his old way by force.</p>
               <p>Ah fooliſh people (and full of wit) will you call on him to come to judgement and ſtop his way with cruelty? is not the day of the Lord darkneſs to you who deny the light? Gods wayes are not yours, nor his thoughts yours who are <pb n="50" facs="tcp:154301:26"/> vain therein; will you hedge up his way againſt him? will you ſet Briars and Thorns before him? and ſhall not the light of <hi>Iſrael</hi> kindle a fire amongſt you? ſhall not he go through and tread you down, and with your own tear you as a Lyon from whom none ſhall deliver?</p>
               <p>Was it not thus with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they builded Temples and increaſed their Altars, and multiplied their Sacrifices? and what was the end, was it not all to ſin? for thereby they ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves againſt the way of the Lord in his Prophets, and bleſſed themſelves in their worſhips, &amp; ſaid no evil ſhould come upon them, for they made many prayers, but their hands were full of blood, for the beſt of them were become as a Bryar in the way of the Innocent, and the moſt upright as a Thron-hedge in the way of his Servants, in whom he appeard againſt their back-ſliding evils and falſe worſhips, but they were not ſo to their own Teachers, for them they fed fat, and gave gifts, rewards and hire to them; ſo having got Prophets of their own in their way, then they joyned together, and one cryed peace to another, and when God came to break that peace in his way, and to tell them it was not his peace, then they all joyned to hedge him out, and made a wall againſt him of their own righteouſneſſe which they daubed up with their increaſe of Sacrifices and falſe worſhips, ſo they ſaid they were innocent people, ſaid ſo, and Prieſt, and Prophets and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſaid ſo, for they had trimed their own wayes, ſo they ſaid they ſhould have peace, and he that told them truth then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their troubler.

               <p>So now read your wayes at this day and meaſure them in Truth, and ſee what it is you are hedging out, who it is, and what is his meſſage againſt, and what is his manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and your manner of oppoſing, that ſo if it were poſſible you might come to ſee a glimps of the old way and of your own <pb n="51" facs="tcp:154301:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> work; is it not he that comes to cry out againſt that which is wicked in your ſtreets, and falſe in your worſhips, that's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your enemy, and breaks your peace, whom your hedge cannot ſtop nor your wall keep out? how many bryars and Thorns are ſet againſt him at this day to take hold of him if he do but open his mouth in your ſtreets, what Law new and old there is to make him an offender for a word in your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; how is he beat in your Synagogues, haled before Rulers and caſt into Priſons? how is the Scriptures fulfilled upon you, and his witneſſe doubled againſt you manifold over, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all your forefathers of whom you read, and yet you ſay you are innocent, you are no perſecutors but for liberty of Conſcience, they were perſecutors that ſo uſed him in the Prophets and in the Apoſtles, and in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes that ſo uſed Martyrs, &amp;c. but cannot ſee your work of the ſame nature, which <hi>Queen Maries</hi> Laws are far too ſhort for you to accompliſh, but with many additions thereto are you in much fury driving on to deſtruction, yet having trimed your own way, ſay you, we are Chriſtians and have a Goſpel Miniſtry of godly men, &amp;c.

               <p>But how ſhould you know his way who denies his light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

               <p>And here now may all read the worſhip in ſpirit in ſuch as know God in ſpirit, and the worſhip in Letter in them that

               <p>And now to you he is come of whom you have been long talking, and in that way he appears among you of which you are Preaching; The
<hi>Jews</hi> had but the propheſies and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to know him by reading without them, but you read and Preach in words of the lively pattern in ſpirit, and have heard of the ſame Life and Teſtimony which now he bears againſt you in his Temples, and when he comes you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him who ſuffers the ſame things among you. Oh <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> how wilt thou ſtand in judgement, what wilt thou plead for thy ſelfe, when he ariſes to judgement, whoſe Teſtimony againſt thee is drawing to an end? what will be thy excuſe, and who wilt thou ſay thou took him to be, who now endures ſuch contradiction againſt himſelf, ſuch haling, beatings, ſcourgings, and mockings, and baniſhings, impriſonings and death, without reſiſtings? haſt not thou heard of him before he came, that thou might have known in this thy day the things of thy peace? haſt thou not read of him that is ſent to ſeek his loſt, in Temples &amp; Synagogues, in Markets, and where the greateſt of the people be, in which manner he now appears, &amp; being refuſed of the rich, gathers the poor in the high wayes and hedges, &amp; yet hath no where to lay his own head, haſt thou not heard of the everlaſting way of his walkings in Prophets and Apoſtles, &amp; his pilgrimage in their bodies upon earth, who <pb n="56" facs="tcp:154301:29"/> was ever a ſtranger in the world at his coming from heaven? what ſpirit wilt thou ſay this is which hath conformed ſo many at this day, who was amongſt you like wolves to devour others, now to ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods, and torturings of their bodies, and taking away their lives without ſeeking the leaſt revenge, wilt thou at that day ſay thou had thought it had been the ſpirit of the Devil, as many of you now doth, though in your conſciences otherwiſe convinced?</p>
               <p>Alas for thee, how art thou wept over at this day? And what a lamentable ſorrow hath many of the Lords ſervants for thee, whom thou haſt caſt in holes and priſons for their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God and teſtimony of their conſcience towards God in them, whoſe patient ſufferings, and unparaleld cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are no more valued with thee then if they were dogs? and this hath gone throughout thee from the leaſt to the greateſt till there be very few left which are not wholly hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſo that to hear of theſe evil dealings exerciſed upon the innocent doth no more enter your hearts, then the rain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a rock; wherefore our ſouls are troubled for you and our hopes concerning your healing grows dayly leſs, and our ſufferings in the Lord Jeſus dayly greater, haſting to the full, and what will you do in the end thereof? Or whom ſhall we take to witneſs for you? or may you be compared with any that ever hardned themſelves in theſe wayes and eſcaped deſtruction, that our hopes might revive and our prayers not ceaſe, did ever any thus deny the life of what yon Preach in words your ſelves, and which ſome of you have in meaſure felt and ſuffered for, and have been anſwered in by the Lord, and your eyes have ſeen the vengeance of the Almighty, and how dreadful it hath been both upon Kings, Prieſts and Rulers for reſiſting? Ah how much better had it been for you never to have known theſe things, which you have ſeen, read and Preached, then now that they ſhould be fulfilled upon you to the uttermoſt? how well had it been for you had you been as thoſe you call heathen, rather then to Profeſs Chriſt and thus act againſt him at his coming, even in the ſame way your ſelves Preach him?</p>
               <p>Alas, alas, what hath the innocent done, why he thus is uſed among you? doth he cry againſt ſin, againſt pride, againſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:154301:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> falſe worſhips, againſt corrupt Rulers, corrupt Teachers, corrupt Lawyers, &amp;c. And with much meekneſs bears his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt theſe evils in you for a teſtimony of light to your words, whom he hath lifted up in wrath and zeal and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the ſame things in the perſons of others? and will not this ariſe againſt you of which you are witneſſes all in one generation? But ſay thou he breaks the peace, and breaks our Law, and is unmannerly, &amp;c. But was he not ever ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and is he not now in the ſame way he ever walked? what would that peace do for you (could you keep it whole) which is broken by reproving ſin and deceit? Is there any peace to the wicked from God? &amp; will be keep that Law which will not give him liberty to Reign in his Temples, and to lead his people by his Spirit? or will you plead that Law againſt him in judgement when he comes to deal with you, who ſhould know his Law written in your hearts to limit you, and not your Laws to limit him, nor your manners muſt not bind the conſcience where he is known to be King? and this you know is truth and have pleaded it againſt others, and now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not own it, will not the Laws of Chriſt and the manners of Chriſt of which you read in Scripture agree with your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and peace, who calls for his Kingdom to come amongſt you, and profeſs to rule according to Scriptures? how will this ſtand at that day when you muſt not be your own Judges, nor by your own Laws? And why is he counted your enemy ſeeing his appearance now is in love to give you light out of this (for your Eternal ſalvation) againſt which he will certainly come in Judgement to condemnation? Have you not heard of the love of the Father to the world, who ſends his Son to lay down his Life therein for a light to the world, that whoſoever believeth therein might not be condemned? can you read and confeſs this life laid down in the Prophets, in Chriſt, in the Apoſtles, in the Martyrs, and in all in whom this righteous blood hath been ſhed from <hi>Abel</hi> to your time, and can you not ſay they were blind Prieſt and People who could not ſee this innocent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer in his ſeveral appearances? And what will you ſay of your ſelves, ſeeing the ſame teſtimony is before your eyes,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154301:30"/> but not received? was ever his ſufferings ſo increaſed in ſo little a time, and for ſuch little fooliſh things (as your ſelves calls them) which though they ſeem little yet much innocent blood hath been ſhed, and this life is laid down dayly in many? And why ſhould you count that ſo little, which your brethren count dearer then their precious life? Is there any thing makes it ſo but the tenderneſs of the one, and hardneſs of the other? But ſay you, they are guilty of their own blood to ſuffer for ſuch fooliſh things, but who is their executioners? do not you ſuffer fools dayly, they ſhall witneſs againſt you, that there is ſomething in it more then folly? have you not read that God chuſeth the fooliſh things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſe, and baſe deſpiſed things to bring to nought things that are, and weak things to confound the mighty? and can you read and Preach this and not ſee it fulfilled nor underſtand without a meaning? then take heed how you call that fooliſh which God hath choſen to lay down his life in for a witneſs againſt the murtherer in the wiſe men of the world, will you call that fooliſhneſs whereby the myſteries of God comes to be manifeſt, and that which he hath choſen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf in openly in his Temples and his worſhip, his ſervice, and his ſuffering long in meekneſs, and the Devil in his Temples, with his ſervants, his pride, his raſhneſs and cruelty, and to lay each open to the ſimpleſt heart by their fruits, which have been long covered with words, but now every one that knowes a Wolfe from a Lamb may ſee and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived? will you call this little which diſcovers ſo great a depth of deceit ſo cloſely hid, and opens the painted Sepulchres, and ſearches the heart of the deceitful, laying it open to your ſelves and others, which elſe you could not have known nor believed if you were told it? could many of you have believed the prince of pride had ruled in you til you ſee him act you in cruelty on your brethren becauſe they cannot worſhip you? or could you have believed that the murtherer had been there till you proceed to caſt into priſons your brethren &amp; keep them there till death for theſe little things? And theſe things ſome ſuffer under you for a witneſs, and the reſt are ſpared (though that ſpirit would have none to live) that the Scriptures may be fulfilled, Satan ſhal caſt ſome of you into priſon, &amp;c. And <pb n="59" facs="tcp:154301:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> are not theſe things manifeſtly laid open to your ſelves and all that are not willingly blind, and alſo the contrary Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus where theſe things are patiently endured? And will you call this fooliſhneſs, which thus leaves all the world without excuſe, and prepares all for righteous Judgement? many had little thought theſe little things ſhould have opened ſuch great ſecrets, or this folly have confounded ſuch wiſdom, when a ſubtle ſpirit hath been ſome years getting knowledge, and words and Religion to make himſelf fair without, that others may believe him to be a ſuffering Saint, and one of theſe little things ariſes in his way, which diſcover him to be a devouring Wolfe in a moment; may not the wiſe then true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay the weakneſs of God is greater then the wiſdom of men, and God hath choſen fooliſh things to confound the wiſe? And now the Scripture is fulfilled to your face whether you (ſeeing) can perceive or no, and the rock of offence is laid and the ſtone of ſtumbling though he be refuſed; And he is come whom we have looked for, in the thouſands of his Saints, and the head over his Church, and his body he is preparing dayly that the Fathers will may be done in Earth, and that he may take vengeance of them that know him not, nor will receive his teſtimony, who will not believe his light that now ſhineth, but take pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, though he be come after their own Preaching, and many are his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes at his day; glory to his brightneſs, and let the Son ariſe and Reign for ever in whom alone the Scriptures are now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, and the builders reject him, and the wicked make prey upon him where he turns from iniquity, and the ſpoiling of goods is ſuffered joyfully, and the havock is made of the Church, and he is taken from priſon and from Judgement, and the reproach of many he bears, and the back is given to the ſmiter, and he that ſues at the Law for the coat may take the Cloak alſo, &amp; he that would have the Hat take the head and body alſo without reſiſting, and prayers and tears is ſhed for them that hate and deſpitefully uſe him, and goods are taken away and not asked again, &amp; this is our beloved, and this is his voice, and his ſheep knows it, and follows him, and thus it is written of him, and thus it is now read, and glory to him that liveth and Reigneth for ever, who was and is, and is come.</p>

               <p>Now lay your words and your works in the true Ballance, and weigh them with the Words of Life and Power of his Name, and meaſure of Truth and Honeſty, and lye not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth; But you that are under the power of theſe wickedneſſes, and in bondage thereto, who ſee (and are not aſhamed to ſay) you cannot but commit theſe abominations while you live, do not lye againſt the work of Chriſt, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath Redeemed you, when you are yet in this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; neither count his blood an unholy thing, in ſaying you are waſhed, nor his Work imperfect, nor mix it with the work of the Devil; but give to each his own, that thereby they may be known, and in what Name every thing is wrought; For now is Truth come to try you, and he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing <pb n="66" facs="tcp:154301:34"/> who will have his own, and nothing but his own, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what pretence ſoever.

And have you let this be over-run with weeds while you have been aſleep in your ſloth and idleneſs, cares &amp; pleaſures of the world, till all be filled with bryars and thorns, and corrupt plants that now are ſpread and bring forth? And now the Lord is come who is the light of the world, to ſeek fruits of his own, and will you hold him forth theſe curſed fruits, and cover them with his Name, as though they were his, and ſeek to force them upon him whether he will or no, and fall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon him if he deny them?</p>
               <p>Now if this be not ſo, what means this, That when any one in his Name is ſent to reprove ſin in the Streets or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets where it abounds, and in the Name of Chriſt to Declare againſt falſe worſhips, never ſet up by him (which hath been his manner in all his appearances) and to call for what is his own, and to deny the works of the Devil, that preſently all is in an uproar, and a tumult raiſed, pulling and beating, and haling to Priſon, beaten in Markets, beaten in your Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, ſhamefully intreated in your Streets, and all for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offence, but becauſe he calls for his own, and denies what is not of him? Doth not this Blaſpheme that Holy Name by which they are called, and which your ſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs? Teacher cryes away with him, and tumult cryes away with him, its not fit he ſhould live. And what uſage he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from you in his members is openly ſeen, and God is daily bringing your works to light. Now let the wiſe in heart, who can diſcern the ſigns of the times, read, if the Parable be not fulfilled upon you Husbandmen; And will you guild this Cup over with fine words, forms and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and call them Deceivers and Blaſphemers, who in love to your Souls and obedience to Chriſt tells you of it, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies againſt it, in all long-ſuffering and patience? Who will be found the deceivers and the deceived, when your guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154301:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> covers comes to be pulled off, and you muſt drink of the Cup your ſelves as you have filled: and this is certainly near at hand to come upon you, and you are haſting towards it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, your Cup is almoſt full, and with the light are you ſeen; Hath not the Lamb ſet up his Teſtimony againſt you almoſt in every place of the Nation? How many Towns have yon in which the Innocent have not ſuffered violence for crying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, in the Name of Chriſt, calling for the fruits of Righteouſneſs? How many Priſons have you that do not ſpeak your cruelty? How many Counties have you in which Innocent blood hath not been ſhed, which daily ſpeaks? How many of your Synagogues have the Children of light born witneſs in againſt your evil wayes, wherein they have been beaten, haled, pulled and puniſhed? And all this you drink up as a thing of nought, and are yet thirſtier then at firſt; Are theſe the works of Chriſt, or of the old Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer?</p>
               <p>Wherefore ceaſe to Blaſpheme, for you are meaſured by that which will not lye, and with your own Rule are you found in the works of the old deceiver, and the old perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and in their Oppoſition and Blaſphemy againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, where it teſtifies againſt your evil deeds. So ſeeing you are found in the works of the old Perſecutors, and in their nature, take to you their name, for that is truth, and will be your Inheritance amongſt them; and ceaſe to Blaſpheme the Name of Chriſt by taking it upon you to cover theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hide your ſin from your own eyes, and ſo deceive your own Souls, and others that are blind; but who comes in the Name of Chriſt, comes in the light to prove you open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſees you, and gives light in the life of Chriſt for all to diſcern betwixt the Lamb and the Wolf, by their nature and not by their cloathing.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the Holy annointing wherewith all that are in him ſees out of theſe things to be led, and every appearance of his from
<hi>Cain</hi> the firſt murtherer till this day declares theſe to be the works of the Devil, and by works of a contrary nature doth witneſs againſt them; In which life he is the light of the world, who though he be in the midſt of Gods Throne <pb n="68" facs="tcp:154301:35"/> (ſeen ſo to his own) yet as a Lamb ſlain amongſt theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean beaſts, ſhining forth in the life of Meekneſs, Holineſſe, Patience and Long-ſuffering, enduring all things from his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; which light and life, though to the wiſdom of the wiſe world it appears poor, baſe and contemptible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the builders rejected; yet it is full of Grace and Truth, and hath power with God over the Devil, and all theſe his works, and by Faith in his Name, and by the vertue of his Nature, all that are in him bear his Teſtimony againſt the worlds works and nature: for in that Name is Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Life and Peace, and the Ark of his ſtrength and ſafety in the great deſtruction that is to come upon the world for theſe things: and he is ever at the Arm of Gods ſtrength, and ſits at his right hand in heavenly places, and with him to gather and ſave his Elect from the ends of the earth; and by his ſufferings to redeem them from under theſe ungodly powers, and to break the bonds of iniquity; and therefore they who are gathered into this Name, holds it as a Holy Power, and dare not Blaſpheme it, but ſay, Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity, which Name to ſuch is Salvation, and ſtrength, and righteouſneſs, meekneſs and peace.</p>
               <p>Ah blind people, that have eyes and ſee not', What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your profeſſion of Names, your Forms and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and how is God departed out of all (as to you) and your houſe is become deſolate, and where light, truth and peace ſhould dwell, its become a habitation of devourers, a place of Owls and Dragons, and night birds, and beaſts of prey? ſuch ſpirits rule in all your holy things in which you truſt; You cry the Name of Chriſt, but ſee not, nor is your eye annointed; you cry the Name of Jeſus, but are not ſaved from your ſins; you cry Chriſt is your King, but have not Peace; you cry great is the Lord with your lips, but the Devil prevails in your hearts, and caries you captive at his will, contrary to the Will of the Lord; So you have got the words of Saints, but the life you have loſt; ſheep in words, but wolves in nature; and ſo are in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs againſt ſuch as recain the power of what you profeſs.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154301:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> Now are not theſe vain words you truſt in, which doth not ſave? This is the deceiver you tell on, who makes people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in a lye, and now he is found in your own boſom; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the day which hath brought his works to light, glory to God for evermore. Wherefore let not your own thoughts deceive you, and lead you to caſt upon others that which in your ſelves is found, but leave your vain and evil thoughts of others, and Judge your own ſelves with the light of life, and meaſure your works with truth, and not with thoughts; Did not they that perſecuted the Prophets think they did God ſervice? And they that perſecuted Chriſt thought the ſame; and they that perſecuted the Apoſtles and Saints of old knew not that they perſecuted Chriſt Jeſus, but thought they did well to puniſh Hereticks and Blaſphemers; and they that ſlew the Martyrs were of the ſame ſpirit, and ſo of the ſame mind. And now come to your ſelves and your thoughts in this your work, which is the ſame at this day, and many of you have the ſame thoughts, though ſome of you act clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what you ſee, and ſo exceed all your fore-fathers; and now ſee who are Deceivers and Blaſphemers, and where the Lamb is led to the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>Ah you Teachers of theſe Nations, ſhould you thus have uſed your liberty you had given of God from under the dark power that ruled (in part) in the Biſhops, under which ſome of you ſuffered? Was it not then in your hearts, that if you had but liberty, you would go on to the rooting out of the reliques of Popery, and Idol worſhips, and perſecution? Should you not have gone on with ſingleneſs of heart, as you had liberty, to the end? Then had you been faithful to God and the Nations; then had you been as openers of the Holy Pathes for men to walk in, and breakers of oppreſſion, and men ſhould have called you the bleſſed of God; then had you not inherited this curſed thing ſet up by your fathers the old perſecutors and oppreſſors (whoſe children you are now found to appear) then had you not bin at this day found fighting for their fat benefits which ſpued them out; ſuing your People for Tithes, pigs, geeſe, ſmoke, and ſuch like traſh, haling poor people to Priſon, and ſpoiling their Houſes <pb n="70" facs="tcp:154301:36"/> and Lands for your bellies: you had been at this day in a more honourable work then raking in theſe Dung-hills. The Lord ſhould not have needed to have called your own hearers from under your elbows, and ſent them againſt you into your Meetings to Declare your ſhame openly, and to caſt this dung in your faces, laying open your deceitful works and worſhips which falls ſo heavy upon you, that you have not ſtrength left to ſtand before the guilt thereof, nor have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defence, but either to fly, or cry out to the earthly powers to help you againſt him who is now become your Adverſary. It was not thus with you while you were ſufferers for ſtanding faithful to what you then knew of Gods new work. I appeal to that of God in your own Conſciences, if then a ſilly boy or girle, or man or woman had asked you a queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Doctrine or Manners, if you would have uſed either your feet to fly, or your hand to ſmite, or cryed, away with him, Officer take him to Priſon, Magiſtrate make a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Acts were then abomination to you; you had then another Weapon, even a meaſure of the Spirit to inform the weak with meekneſs, &amp; to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers; But then you were ſufferers your ſelves for your Conſcience, and ſo the Caſe is changed with you, and the Spirit alſo, as far as the ſufferer is from the perſecutor; One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here the deceiver keeps you blind, in that you keep the old form you then had, but poſſeſſed with another ſpirit; So your ſticking in the form hath deceived you of the ſuffering Spirit, and the Power of meekneſs, which had you been led by the Spirit of the Lamb, you had been at this day in the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, not tormenters of thoſe that are. Have not I heard ſome of you in publick Declare, That if a Church had perſecution in it for Conſcience ſake upon any account whatſoever, it needed no further Tryal to prove it to be of the Devil, and not of the Church of Chriſt. But ſince the ſame perſon (though no mean one of account amongſt the fineſt ſort of Teachers) have commanded them to Priſon who came but into the Synagogue, and ſpoke not one word. Alas for your Souls! how are you fallen under the curſed thing, that you ſhould be they who are left to fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <pb n="71" facs="tcp:154301:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> of what the Biſhops came ſhort of. Ah! how are you to be pittied? Will not your cutting them off riſe againſt you? And will not God avenge their blood upon you, ſeeing you have condemned their perſons, but juſtifie the things for which they were cut off, by adding manifold thereto of the ſame nature. God is Judge this day, and his light in your hearts, how you have dealt with him &amp; his Inheritance, whom you ſhould have led out of theſe things, going before them into the Kingdom of God; but are now found in the work of gain-ſaying ſuch as are coming out of darkneſs into light, neither entring your ſelves, nor ſuffering them that would. So let truth for ever ſtand upon the head of the deceiver and blaſphemer, and let ſuch as are ſeduced by them be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal delivered. And bleſſed be the Lamb for ever, whoſe life is this day become a light to devide the Sheep from the Wolves, that he may come to Judgement.</p>
